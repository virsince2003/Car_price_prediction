# Description

## What does this project do?

1. This project takes the parameters of a used car like Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
2. It then predicts the possible price of the car. You can predict the price of your car ðŸ˜‰.

## How does this project do?

1. First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com, which has data till year 2019 (https://quikr.com).
    Link for data: https://github.com/virsince2003/Car_price_prediction/blob/main/dataset/quikr_car.csv
2. The data was cleaned (it was very unclean :( ) and analysed.

3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.87 R2_score.

4. This project is about making a website built on  Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
